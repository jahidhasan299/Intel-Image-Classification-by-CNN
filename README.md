# Intel-Image-Classification-by-CNN:
In this project, we will be working on Intel images i.e. images of buildings, forest, street, etc. We will built a convolutional neural network and train it on this images. This is a multi class classification problem and we will use Keras.

# THE STEPS ARE TAKEN TO COMPLETE THIS PROBLEM:
1. Mounting google drive on colab notebook
2. Visualizing the image that we will be working on
3. Analyzing the dimensions to verify if all images have same dimensions.
4. Converting the images into a numpy array and normilize them.
5. Checking class imbalance
6. Spliting the data and performing one-hot encoding
7. Creating the model architecture, compliling the mode and fit it.
8. Plotting the accuracy and loss against each epoch.
9. Preprocessing the test data and make predicting onit.
10. Visualizing the orginal and predicted labels for the test images

# Usefull of this Project:
This project can be used for educational purposes to get a better understanding of how create network architectute for a CNN model. You can further hyperparameter tune this model to reach higher accuracy.

# Scope: 
This project has vast scope, IT can be used to classify satellite images, drone images, google images into differnt classses like sea, mountain etc.

# Result:
